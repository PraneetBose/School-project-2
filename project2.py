# Python3 Program to
# accept five number , find their sum and average

#making 5 variables, namely -a ,b ,c ,d and e
a=float(input("Enter the First number - "))
b=float(input("Enter the Second number- "))
c=float(input("Enter the Third number- "))
d=float(input("Enter the Fourth number- "))
e=float(input("Enter the Fifth number- "))
#finding the Sum using the int stored in the 5 variables .
print("The Sum of the given numbers are =  ",a+b+c+d+e)
#finding the average of the int
print("The Average of the given numbers are  = ",a+b+c+d+e/5)
